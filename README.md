Quake 4 Final Project (IT-266-102)
==================================

Objective: Design a capture-the-flag based gamemode that implements gameplay changes and additional functionality.

Power-ups: To request a power-up, press the x key. The power-up that you receive is completely random and there is a slight chance you will not be given one at all. The cooldown for requesting power-ups is 30 seconds. To use the power-up that you last obtained, press the e key.

Weapons: The stats of each weapon have been modified to encourage greater use of the newly-implemented power-up system. Therefore, the fire rate, damage, ammo amount, flash intensity and/or color of each weapon are different from that of the original capture-the-flag gamemode. Players can increase the damage of weapons through the use of the power-ups.

Movement changes: To further encourage use of the power-up system and capture-the-flag aspect of the game, players are now able to jump a lot higher, and even run quicker when the haste power-up is in use.
